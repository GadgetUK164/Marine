<h1>Marine (Amber Replacement)</h1>
Marine is a modern CPLD replacement, designed to replace the Amber chip in the Commodore Amiga.
This project is based on the work of Matthias Heinrichs - AGA Multifix.

A massive thanks to Matthias for creating the AGA Multifix, and for allowing me to adapt to an Amber replacement.
